# PROJECT WABABLAS PRO - STATUS LOG (FOR NEXT SESSION)
# Last Updated: Friday, January 30, 2026

## 1. CORE ARCHITECTURE
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (Glassmorphism UI).
- Backend: Electron (Main) + Express Server (Port 3000) for WhatsApp API.
- Database/Auth: Appwrite Cloud (Project: 697c2e990012b54cca7b).
- WA Engine: Baileys (Library) with API-Based Polling (Stable for Network Access).

## 2. RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS
- Phase 1-3: Auth & Smart Database (Universal Search, Pagination, rumus Excel Fix) -> DONE.
- Phase 4: WhatsApp Gateway (API-Based, QR Code Polling, Session Isolation by userId) -> DONE & STABLE.
- Phase 5.1: Campaign Setup UI (Presenter ID, Audience Filter, Smart Batching/Target Success Logic) -> DONE.

## 3. TECHNICAL NOTES (IMPORTANT)
- Native Modules Bypass: 'bufferutil' & 'utf-8-validate' are set as EXTERNAL in vite.config.ts and excluded from optimizeDeps.
- WhatsApp Engine: Running in "Pure JS Fallback" mode for maximum portability (No C++ compiler needed).
- IPC vs API: WhatsApp events use HTTP Polling to Port 3000 instead of IPC to allow Mobile/Network access.

## 4. NEXT MISSION: PHASE 5.2 (AI MESSAGE COMPOSER)
- Task: Build UI for writing messages.
- Requirements: Variable injection ({name}, {school}), AI Character selection, and Live Preview.
- State Store: Use 'useCampaignStore' (Zustand) to pass data to the final Blast Execution.

## 5. RECENT FILE UPDATES
- src/store/useCampaignStore.ts (New)
- src/pages/Blast.tsx (UI Overhauled)
- electron/server.ts (Stability Fixed)
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (Premium Control Center UI)

# LOG ENDS: SYSTEM READY FOR BLAST ENGINE EXECUTION.
